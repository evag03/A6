We collaborated with Bintu Jalloh during this assignment.

Eva's reflection:
    What went well was the process of using parts of the various near misses with others. For example, we found ourselves stuck
    at trying tom implement the insertion method, but were able to figure it out by doing the subtitution first as we had gained
    a better understanding of the alphebet variable. What ended up being difficult was creating the tests, as our approach to
    the near misses as we didn't make them each their own methods. This left us at a temporary loss on how to test as we're
    used to testing functions rather than a bunch of for loops. In the future, I'm going to be more meticulous on realizing when
    it may be most helpful to use methods, possibly by including hypothetical methods in the blueprints for programs.

Musa's reflection:
    What went well during this assignment was something that I had reflected on before, being able to trace out what a method is
    doing in order to debug it. This came in handy when we were trying to debug our program at the end to figure out why our code
    wouldn't recognize that it had already talked about a misspelled word when reading a file. Eventually, through tracing it out,
    we figured out that it was because we were initializing the hashset of checked words in the while loop instead of outside of it, 
    making it empty each time and leaving the computer unable to see if it had already checked a word. However, what challenged us was 
    trying to figure out how to fix our insertions method. 

    However, what I struggled with during this assignment was being able to apply the discrete mathematics concepts (ooh wow I noticed it)
    to our work. The expressions in the instructions wasn't just for calculating how many combinations of letters we could make, it was also
    just helpful for seeing where in the query we would be doing each nearMiss method, specifically in the insertion method where we 
    had to insert letters even after the end of the word and before the beginning of the word.
